# Athghnó
### Athghnó — Activity or work that needs to be redone, usually because it wasn't done right the first time.

Athgnó is an ActivityPub server written in Go, currently a work in progress.
The purpose is to create a spec-conformant server with room for extension,
making it capable of running any potential ActivityPub 'app'.
